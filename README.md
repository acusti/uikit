## Tests

The monorepo uses jest to run its tests. To run tests across all packages,
use `yarn test`. To run them in watch mode, use `yarn test:watch`.

## Building and Publishing

To build all packages, run `yarn build`. This will trigger `tsc --build`
and `yarn flowgen` for all packages.

To build the storybook docs, run `yarn build:stories`, which will run
`yarn build` and then the default storybook `build` command.

To publish all packages, manually update each packagesâ€™s `version` field in
their package.json. If any of the packages depends on any of the other
packages being updated, be sure to update the dependency version as well.
Then run `yarn publish`. Publishing will trigger a build before running
`npm publish` to ensure that the latest changes are published. To publish
only a single package, use
`yarn workspace <package-name> npm publish --access public` (e.g.
`yarn workspace @acusti/css-value-input npm publish --access public`), but
note that in that case, you are responsible for running `yarn build`
yourself before triggering the publish.

After publishing the packages, run `yarn` to update the yarn.lock file and
then commit the version updates with a message in the form of:
`:arrow_up: Bump package versions to _._._`.

## Developing

The two main run scripts for developing are `yarn start:watch`, which kicks
off the TypeScript compiler in `--watch` mode, and `yarn start:stories`,
which kicks off the default `storybook` command from packages/docs/. To run
both of those in a single terminal window, use `yarn start`.
