Adapt package to use react-compiler as part of vite build process and to
remove all manual memoization. Also includes some small changes to strictly
follow react-compilerâ€™s rules of react and to workaround as-of-yet
unimplemented features involving mutating destructured component props and
the nullish coalescing assignment operator.

**Note:** this is a breaking change because the packages now depend on
react v19+ and are no longer compatible with anything before the
introduction of the react/compiler-runtime.
