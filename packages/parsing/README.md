`@acusti/parsing` exports `parseAsJSON`, a function that takes a string and
attempts to parse it as JSON, returning the resulting JS value, or `null`
if the string defeated all attempts at parsing it. This is especially
useful for generative AI when you prompt an LLM to generate a response in
JSON, because most models are unable to consistently generate valid JSON,
and even when they do, will often have a pre- or post-amble as a part of
the response.

The [unit tests][] show the kinds of LLM responses and syntax errors that
the package can fix and convert into a valid result.

## Usage

```
npm install @acusti/parsing
# or
yarn add @acusti/parsing
```

Import `parseAsJSON` (it’s a named export) and pass a string to it:

````js
import { parseAsJSON } from '@acusti/parsing';

// it might neglect to close the outer curly braces
parseAsJSON(`  Sure, here's an example of a JSON response for the "Contact Form" page:
{
    "heading": "Get in Touch",
    "form": {
        "email": "info@example.net",
        "message": "Please enter your message or inquiry below"
    }
`);
/* results in:
{
    heading: 'Get in Touch',
    form: {
        email: 'info@example.net',
        message: 'Please enter your message or inquiry below',
    },
}
*/

// you might get a "key": "value" list with no syntax around it
parseAsJSON(` Here are the props for the "Blog" page:

Again, there are more examples of the kinds of things that the parser can
handle in the [unit tests][].

Also, if you’re wondering the best way to get an LLM to return JSON, I
found the few-shot prompting approach suggested in Pinecone’s [Llama 2: AI
Developers Handbook][] helpful with a variety of different models (Llama 2
7B, OpenChat 3.5, OpenHermes 2.5, Zephyr 7B).
