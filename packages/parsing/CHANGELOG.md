## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 19052b1: Improve parseAsJSONâ€™s handling of empty inputs

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- e42f474: Use vite in library mode to build all packages and cleanup the
  build artifacts to only include required files. This means no more test
  files in the build and no more src/ directory.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 01ec060: Clean the preamble and postscript texts of code block syntax
  that is commonly used by LLMs to demarcate the boundaries of the JSON
  portion of the response

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- Update all NPM and CI dependencies to latest, including eslint,
  typescript (v5.8.3), vitest, babel, and node-gyp, resolving all known
  security vulnerabilities, and adopt the eslint canonical plugin and
  enable new rules.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- **Breaking!** parseAsJSON now returns
  `{ preamble: string, postscript: string, value }`, where `value` is the
  parsed value that used to be the entire return value of the function, and
  the `preamble` and `postscript` properties are always strings and return
  the text (trimmed) that came before or after the stringified JSON value
  respectively (or an empty string if no text was returned).

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 3f3d39d: Switch over all eslint sorting and organizing rules to use the
  Perfectionist plugin and enable the eslint no-duplicate-imports rule
