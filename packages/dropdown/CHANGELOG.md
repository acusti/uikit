# @acusti/dropdown

## 0.48.1

### Patch Changes

-   - Updated dependencies
        - @acusti/styling@2.0.1

## 0.48.0

### Minor Changes

- f87de22: Refactor @acusti/dropdown off of @acusti/use-is-out-of-bounds by
  implementing support for CSS anchor positioning as the way to support
  collision detection. This includes some fundamental changes to the base
  styles applied to `.uktdropdown`, including that it is no longer
  `position:relative` and no longer `display: inline-block`. All of the
  positioning and anchoring logic is implemented via plain CSS with useful
  defaults, so updating the behavior is as simple as providing your own
  styles to override the low-specificity styles rendered by the component.
  See `packages/docs/stories/Dropdown.stories.tsx` and
  `packages/docs/stories/Dropdown.css` for examples of how that works.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [3f2cee2]
    - @acusti/use-bounding-client-rect@2.0.1

## 0.47.0

### Minor Changes

- e42f474: Use vite in library mode to build all packages and cleanup the
  build artifacts to only include required files. This means no more test
  files in the build and no more src/ directory.
- d328a73: Adapt package to use react-compiler as part of vite build
  process and to remove all manual memoization. Also includes some small
  changes to strictly follow react-compilerâ€™s rules of react and to
  workaround as-of-yet unimplemented features involving mutating
  destructured component props and the nullish coalescing assignment
  operator.

    **Note:** this is a breaking change because the packages now depend on
    react v19+ and are no longer compatible with anything before the
    introduction of the react/compiler-runtime.
