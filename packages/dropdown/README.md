`Dropdown` is a React component that renders a menu-like UI with a trigger
that the user clicks to disclose a dropdown positioned below the trigger.
The body of the dropdown can include any DOM, and many dropdowns can be
combined to form a multi-item menu, like the system menu in the top toolbar
of macOS.
