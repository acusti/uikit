# Date Picker Accessibility Enhancements

## Current State ✅

The date picker components are already keyboard accessible with good semantic HTML:
- ✅ Uses `<button>` elements for all interactive components (day buttons, navigation arrows)
- ✅ All elements are keyboard accessible via Tab/Shift+Tab navigation
- ✅ Enter/Space keys work for date selection and navigation
- ✅ Clear visual focus indicators for keyboard users
- ✅ Proper aria-labels on navigation buttons ("Previous Month", "Next Month")
- ✅ Tab order flows logically through the interface

## Planned Enhancements

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] **Arrow Keys** - Navigate between dates (Left/Right for days, Up/Down for weeks)
- [ ] **Page Up/Down** - Navigate between months (alternative to arrow buttons)
- [ ] **Home/End** - Jump to start/end of current month
- [ ] **Shift + Page Up/Down** - Navigate between years

### Screen Reader Support
- [ ] **ARIA Labels** - Enhanced date labeling with context (e.g., "15th of January 2024, Sunday")
- [ ] **Live Regions** - Announce month changes and date selection
- [ ] **Role Attributes** - Proper grid/gridcell roles for calendar structure
- [ ] **State Announcements** - Selected, disabled, and range states
- [ ] **Instructions** - Screen reader accessible usage instructions

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Arrow Key Navigation (Primary Focus)
**MonthCalendar Component Updates:**
- Add `onKeyDown` handler for arrow key navigation within date grid
- Implement focus management with `useRef` to track current focused date
- Left/Right arrows: navigate between adjacent days
- Up/Down arrows: navigate between weeks (same day, previous/next week)
- Handle month boundaries (focus should move to adjacent month)

**DatePicker Component Updates:**
- Coordinate focus management between multiple MonthCalendar instances (two-up view)
- Handle Page Up/Down for month navigation
- Handle Shift+Page Up/Down for year navigation
- Maintain focus position when navigating between months

### Phase 2: Screen Reader Enhancements (Secondary)
- Enhanced ARIA labels with full date context and day of week
- Live regions for announcing month changes and selections
- Proper grid/gridcell roles for semantic calendar structure
- State announcements for selected dates and range selections
- Usage instructions for screen reader users

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Comprehensive keyboard-only navigation testing
- Mobile accessibility verification (iOS VoiceOver, Android TalkBack)
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Technical Notes
- Current implementation has solid foundation - focus is on enhancing UX
- Arrow key navigation is the most impactful enhancement
- Existing button-based architecture works well with screen readers
